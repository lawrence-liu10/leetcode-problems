# 036. Valid Sudoku
# Difficulty: Medium

# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/

# time to solve: 30 min
# looks pretty simple, we can loop through each row, column, and then box
# use a hsm to store values, if there's ever a duplicate, invalid
# time complexity: O(1) (# of squares is capped)
# space complexity: O(1)
# let's code a simple solution first and see if it can be improved after
