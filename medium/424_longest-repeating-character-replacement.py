# still sick and the knicks lost, rough nightðŸ˜”
# sliding window problem
# at first I was thinking we use a set to hold the letters, but probably a hashmap
# or arr is better, I think arr b/c 26 possible letters only
# in each window, we check len window minus most frequent letter, that gives us 
# the # of elements to replace, if it's <= k, it's the new max
# if it's > k, move left pointer until it isn't
# time to solve: 40 min
# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(1)
